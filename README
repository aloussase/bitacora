This repository contains the activity report for my graduate's thesis on the
performance of distributed tracing.

Now, I must say, I do not agree with the way thesis are handled at my
university.

It's basically selling a product, which I feel trivializes any scientific
endeavour students try to make.

I understand that the real world works through money. That important people
have money instead of red blood cells in their veins. 

But I also look back in history and see that the greatest advancements in
mankind have been driven by passionate people seeking to make the world a
better place, or just by passion itself.

I think passion for money is not strong enough a motivator for change, and when
the people in charge of educating the new generations understand that, only
then will my country be able to look at the future with hopeful eyes.
